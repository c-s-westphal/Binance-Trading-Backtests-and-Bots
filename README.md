# Binance-Trading-Backtest-and-Bots

Here I will store all the machine learning and linear regression backtests and bots I have implemented using the Python binance API. 

The main branch shows the backtesting code I wrote. Where as the Lin_reg_trader branch shows the bots that I wrote based around linear regression. Hopefully if you look at the backtests you will also come to the concluson that simple linear regression is the best stratergy from which to make a bot in the crpto space!
